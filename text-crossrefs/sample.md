Émile Gaboriau published [_L'Affaire Lerouge_ in
1866]{#publication}.[^1]

[^1]: It is a very [fine piece of literature]{#my-evaluation}.

[It was very popular.]{#reception}

See [publication]{.ref} for the publication date. I expressed
my thoughts about it in [my-evaluation]{.ref type=pagenote}.

If you want to know more about _L'Affaire Lerouge_, see [publication>reception]{.ref}.

Here are some precisions.[^2]

[^2]: [Whatever format]{#format} you choose, you can [refer to a note]{#refer-to-note} by the identifier of [any of its spans. You can even [nest spans]{#nested-spans}!]{#which-identifier}

I want to refer to a note:

  * How can I refer to a note by its number? → See [refer-to-note]{.ref}.
  * What formats are supported? → See [format]{.ref}.
  * What if the note contains multiple spans with identifiers? → See [which-identifier]{.ref}.
  * What happens if a span in contained in a span? → See [nested-spans]{.ref}.
